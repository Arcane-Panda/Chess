# Chess
ASCII-based Chess game written in C++

### Preplanning

Grid with different colors and letters representing the pieces.

An array that holds all the positions on the board and can remember which pieces are where

A placeholder AI that performs random moves

The ability to select pieces by inputting their position on regular chess grid (C7 to C6, etc.)

Rules for how the pieces move, and which squares they can move too.

Promotions

For now, just pawns, queens, and kings.

### Download Instructions
Go to the source folder, click on main, and download the chessMain.cpp

The reason we have everything in one file, is because for some weird reason that has to do with network admin permissions, header files don't work.

Please note that this currently only runs in the bash terminal
